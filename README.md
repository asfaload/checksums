# Asfaload Checksums Repo

This is a git repository holding copies of checksums of artifacts published on the internet.
The goal of [Asfaload](https://www.asfaload.com) is to improve the security of downloads from the internet.
Hosting a copy of checksums on a third party server increases the security of downloaders because
now 2 locations have to be breached before compromised files can't be detected.
